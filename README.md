# FleetLab Savings Calculator

This is a web-based calculator built for FleetLab. It uses JavaScript to estimate potential savings and improvements in system performance that can be achieved through the implementation of a mixed fleet of buses and safety-optimized vans. The calculator uses data from a CSV file, parses it with Papa Parse, and creates interactive, user-friendly forms for easy data input. Calculations are performed in real time and the results are visualized using Chart.js.

## Features

- Form for user input
- Dynamic drop-down menus populated based on CSV data
- Real-time calculation of potential savings and improvements
- Visual representation of calculations using Chart.js

## Usage

1. Select a state from the drop-down menu.
2. Select a district from the newly populated drop-down menu.
3. The forms will auto-fill with data from the selected district.
4. Adjust values in the forms as desired.
5. Click "Calculate" to perform the calculation and view the results.
